== Frequently Asked Questions ==

How to this plugin works.

= How do I place an event =

1. You must set your event date through the Month Calendar tab. The calendar works this way:

a) Month view - When you create and save a show in this view, it is considered for the whole day event.
b) Week view - You can set the time start/end of your event for any particular day.
c) Day view - same as week view above.

3. Each show created in the Show Calendar it will post in the Manage Seat section. In this menu, you need to click on the event that you want to Add Seats. Once clicked, you need to download the CSV template. Fill it out and then upload it and that's it. Your show is created. For more detail information on how to form your show go to http://www.wpthemesforevents.com/row-seats-plugin.

4. Reports Menu will present the details of the transaction made by the users who booked tickets.

= My page or post doesn't show up the show/event, what do I do? =

The shortcode will only work in a page or post named "Show".  When you activate the plugin, it will automatically create the page "show" for you.  When you do your first show the shortcode is also created and appears in that page "show".
